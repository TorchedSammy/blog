about myself. Hello!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m sammyette, if you couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell.Some people just call me sammy since it&amp;rsquo;s easier,
or TorchedSammy as that&amp;rsquo;s my username in some places (kinda want to change though).
I write code. It&amp;rsquo;s not good code at all, but it works and lately that is all
that I care about.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Besides programming dumb things, I also watch TV shows like dramas and anime.
I have &lt;a class="link" href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/TorchedSammy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>MyAnimeList&lt;/a> and
&lt;a class="link" href="https://mydramalist.com/profile/torchedsammy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>MyDramaList&lt;/a> profiles linked.
As of now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching &lt;em>What&amp;rsquo;s Wrong with Secretary Kim?&lt;/em> and it&amp;rsquo;s a
romantic comedy show which is a little bit dumb in a fun way.
I haven&amp;rsquo;t watched an anime in a while, and the last that I was looking at
was &lt;em>Ghost Stories&lt;/em> of all things primarily for the &amp;ldquo;so bad that it&amp;rsquo;s good&amp;rdquo;
English dub.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any other free time I have when I&amp;rsquo;m not watching shows, I play some games.
These include Stardew Valley (which I plan to write about soon), Minecraft,
Teeworlds and anything that I have. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been enjoying playing these in
single player lately (also will write about).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you can&amp;rsquo;t tell, I don&amp;rsquo;t write a lot in these. Honestly, a short blog is easier
to read and for me to write but when I have something that I definitely want to
rant about or enthusiastic about then it won&amp;rsquo;t be a minute read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Making a Blog</title><link>https://sammy.is-a.dev/blog/posts/making-a-blog/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2021 22:35:44 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://sammy.is-a.dev/blog/posts/making-a-blog/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello, sammy here. A blog!&lt;br>
I decided to make a blog so I can put some of my random thoughts or do
a write up on something. Why? Why not?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;ll probably be boring and kinda inactive but whatever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you couldn&amp;rsquo;t notice, it&amp;rsquo;s made with Hugo since I thought that would be the
easiest to setup. I previously had my thoughts up &lt;a class="link" href="https://tilde.town/~sammyette/thoughts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>over here&lt;/a>
on tilde.town but this is easier to theme in my opinion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, welcome to my dumb blog!! Hope you enjoy my ramblings on things I don&amp;rsquo;t know about
and rants.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
