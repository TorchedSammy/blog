Hello!
I&amp;rsquo;m sammyette, if you couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell.Some people just call me sammy since it&amp;rsquo;s easier, or TorchedSammy as that&amp;rsquo;s my username in some places (kinda want to change though). I write code. It&amp;rsquo;s not good code at all, but it works and lately that is all that I care about.
Besides programming dumb things, I also watch TV shows like dramas and anime.</description></item><item><title>Making a Blog</title><link>https://sammy.is-a.dev/blog/posts/making-a-blog/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2021 22:35:44 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://sammy.is-a.dev/blog/posts/making-a-blog/</guid><description>Hello, sammy here. A blog!
I decided to make a blog so I can put some of my random thoughts or do a write up on something. Why? Why not?
It&amp;rsquo;ll probably be boring and kinda inactive but whatever.
If you couldn&amp;rsquo;t notice, it&amp;rsquo;s made with Hugo since I thought that would be the easiest to setup. I previously had my thoughts up over here on tilde.town but this is easier to theme in my opinion.</description></item></channel></rss>
