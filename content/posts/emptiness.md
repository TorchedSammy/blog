A lot of people wish that they could have free time to do whatever they want,
that being playing some games or catching up on a TV series. On the other hand,
I wish that I could be occupied with more things.

Since I am still a student, having to deal with a few online classes in the week,
I have a lot of free time to code things or play games. The thing is though that I
find a lot of the games I used to play to be boring now, and I can't be coding literally
everyday since that's gonna get boring as well.

For me, this is where a lingering feeling of emptiness comes from. If I'm not
playing games or working on a project, I'm basically just idling on Discord
bored out of my mind with nothing to do. Life feels boring and not that fun.
A lot of this feeling comes from lack of motivation that I mentioned
[in a previous post](motivation-and-self-esteem) and feeling like an annoyance
in the Discord servers I am in,

I like sharing things, sometimes too much. Not too much as in personal matters as
there isn't anything going on in my personal life but a lot of things that I find
or like to talk about and I frequently feel like I am a pest that no one likes.
